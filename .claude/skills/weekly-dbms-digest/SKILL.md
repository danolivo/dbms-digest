description: Build a weekly, ad-free digest of PostgreSQL and broader DBMS news, research, and cutting-edge tech — including new techniques and inventions in commercial engines (SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, etc.) and real-world migration experience reports. Use this skill whenever the user asks for the "weekly digest", "Postgres digest", "DBMS digest", "database news roundup", "what happened in databases this week", or when a scheduled task asks to generate the weekly database digest. The skill curates high-signal sources, finds items published in the last 7 days, ruthlessly filters out advertising / vendor promotion / marketing fluff, fact-checks claims, and emits a terse headline + one-line list of links. It also discovers and records new emerging sources each run so the source list stays fresh.

# Weekly DBMS Digest

Produce a short, high-signal weekly digest of what actually happened in the PostgreSQL and wider database world: new technologies, real engineering, cutting-edge inventions, and research. This explicitly includes new techniques and inventions in **commercial engines** (SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, DB2, etc.) and **real-world migration experience** reports — the reader cares about what other databases are doing and what actually happens when people move data between them. The reader is a Postgres hacker who is allergic to marketing. The single most important job of this skill is to **separate signal from sales**: surface genuine technical/research content and discard (or clearly flag) advertisement, company promotion, and marketing material.

The output is deliberately terse: each item is a **headline + one line** with a link. The reader wants to scan 15–30 items in two minutes and click into the 3–4 that matter.

## Workflow

Follow these steps in order. Don't skip the filtering and fact-check steps — they are the whole point.

### 1. Establish the time window

The digest covers the **last 7 days** by default (or the span since the previous digest if the user gives one). Compute the date range with `date` so you don't rely on a guessed "today". Items published outside the window are excluded, even if interesting — note them only if genuinely seminal.

### 2. Gather candidate items from known sources

Read `references/sources.md` for the curated source list, grouped into Postgres, broad DBMS, research venues, and aggregators/newsletters. Work through the high-priority sources first. Prefer aggregators (Planet PostgreSQL, DB Weekly) to fan out quickly, then go direct to primary blogs for anything promising.

**Feed-first ingestion (all languages).** The fastest, most reliable, language-agnostic scan is the curated feed list in `references/feeds.opml` — an OPML list of RSS/Atom feeds. Each run, fetch every feed and keep items whose publish date falls in the window; RSS/Atom is plain XML, so a normal fetch works — no browser, no language barrier. Two cases need the **Claude-in-Chrome** browser instead: feeds blocklisted for plain fetch (Reddit's `.rss` is — confirmed) and sources with no feed yet (several Chinese aggregators). Maintain `feeds.opml` like the other source lists: add a feed when you find/confirm one (discover the URL in the browser if the site doesn't advertise it), and drop or flag feeds that 404 or go silent. It's also importable into any reader.

Use web search and page fetches to collect: title, URL, author/source, publish date, and enough of the body to judge it. Cast a wide net here — filtering happens next.

**Scan non-English sources too.** Work the multilingual set in `references/sources.md` (Russian, Chinese, French, German, Japanese). Search in the **native language** — the best regional engineering write-ups never surface in English search, so query with native terms (e.g. база данных, 数据库, base de données) alongside `PostgreSQL`. Apply the same anti-marketing and fact-check bar, and be careful not to let a machine translation distort a technical claim — verify numbers/behaviour against the original or a primary source. Present these per the non-English formatting rule below.

**Tooling for non-English / JS-heavy sources.** Plain page fetches only see raw HTML, so client-rendered or region-specific sites (Chinese aggregators like modb.pro, PolarDB / Alibaba Cloud, PingCAP — also Reddit and Qiita) often return stale or empty content. In order of preference: (1) use each source's **native RSS/Atom feed** (listed in `references/sources.md`) — feeds are dated, language-native, and fetch cleanly; (2) when there's no usable feed, **render the page with the Claude-in-Chrome browser tools** rather than a plain fetch; (3) treat web search as English/US-biased — use it to confirm, not to discover, non-English items. The Chinese ecosystem in particular publishes heavily and is mostly invisible to English search, so lean on its feeds and the browser.

### 3. Scan PostgreSQL mailing lists

Scan the four key lists for the current time window. Use the PostgreSQL list archives at `https://www.postgresql.org/list/<listname>/` (monthly view) or web-search `site:postgresql.org/message-id` with topic keywords to pull specific threads.

**Lists to scan (in priority order):**
- `pgsql-hackers` — new feature proposals, patch reviews, design debates, committer decisions
- `pgsql-bugs` — confirmed bugs and surprising regressions; ignore "user error" threads
- `pgsql-performance` — unexpected slowdowns, benchmark surprises, planner misbehaviour reports
- `pgsql-general` — only surface items where a core developer or committer gave a notable/surprising answer; skip routine user questions

**What qualifies** (be selective — list traffic is high; signal is rare):

*New threads worth surfacing:*
- A new feature or design proposal with a concrete patch or detailed spec
- A confirmed bug or regression with a reproducible test case or bisected commit
- A benchmark result or performance finding that is surprising relative to prior behaviour
- A design debate where the outcome (accept / reject / defer) is itself informative
- A security or data-loss risk being actively discussed

*Changes in ongoing threads worth surfacing:*
- A thread that was stalled or controversial and just reached a resolution (committed, rejected, redesigned)
- A significant objection raised against a previously-accepted approach
- New data (benchmark, counter-example, real-world report) that materially shifts the discussion
- A committer expressing a strong opinion that narrows or redirects the design space

**What to skip:**
- "How do I do X?" threads without a core-developer surprise in the answer
- Patch submissions still in early review with no substantive feedback yet
- Threading noise: replies that just say "+1" or "thanks"
- Build/packaging questions unless a portability bug is confirmed

**How to search:** For each list, search for messages posted in the current week using queries like `pgsql-hackers <topic keyword> site:postgresql.org/message-id` or fetch the monthly archive index. For performance and bugs lists, also try `pgsql-performance regression 2026` or `pgsql-bugs <version>`. Aim to scan at least the subject lines of the top 20–30 threads per list before choosing items.

**Format for mailing list items** (goes in the `## PostgreSQL mailing lists` section):
```
- **[hackers] [<Thread subject>](archive URL)** — <one line: what was proposed/found/decided and why it matters>. *(<proposer/committer>)* `[patch posted]`
- **[bugs] [<Thread subject>](archive URL)** — <one line: confirmed bug / regression / data-loss risk>. *(<reporter>)* `[open]`
```
Tag with the list name in brackets and make the **thread subject the link** — to the thread root in the archive, not a specific reply (unless a specific reply is the event). Add the key person (proposer / committer / reporter) in italics after the line, e.g. `*(Jeff Davis · pgsql-hackers)*`. Append `[committed]`, `[rejected]`, `[patch posted]`, `[needs review]`, or `[open]` to show where things stand.

### 4. Scan community discussion — the “Community pulse”

Read `references/community-sources.md` and scan the **scannable** community sources (the `[public]` / `[js]` ones) for the time window: forums and link aggregators (Hacker News, Lobsters), the database subreddits, Q&A hot lists (DBA Stack Exchange), and any pinned public Telegram channels. The goal is **what people actually argued about this week**, ranked by real engagement (HN points + comments, Reddit upvotes + comments, SE votes/answers) — not by mere existence.

Pick the 3–8 threads with the most substantive discussion. **Dedupe against the rest of the digest**: if a thread is just reactions to an article already listed above, fold it in or skip it — the Community pulse is for discussion that is itself the story (design debates, war stories, “wait, does Postgres really do X?”, surprising benchmarks people are passing around). Apply the same anti-marketing filter, and link to the thread itself.

Follow `community-sources.md`'s upkeep rules every run: **discover** new active DB communities (a fresh subreddit, a Discourse forum, a public Telegram/Matrix channel) and append keepers to its Discovery log; **prune** any listed source that's been silent for ~3 months, is gone, or has turned promotional by moving it to that file's Retired log (with date + reason) so it leaves the weekly scan but isn't blindly re-added. `[auth]` sources (the community Slack / Discord / IRC) stay listed but are **not** scanned until a connector or credential exists — never fabricate their content.

### 5. Collect open calls for papers (CFPs)

Build the closing **Call for papers** section. Unlike the rest of the digest this is **not** bound by the 7-day window — it's forward-looking: list a CFP while its submission deadline is still in the future (as of the run date) and drop it once the deadline passes. Sort by nearest deadline.

Cover two buckets:
- **PostgreSQL community events** — conferences, PGDays, and meetups (PGConf.dev, PGConf.EU, PGConf.NYC/India, Nordic PGDay, PGDay Paris/Boston/UK/Lowlands/Israel, FOSDEM PGDay, Prague PostgreSQL Developer Day, Swiss PGDay, …). Check the Conferences & CFP trackers in `references/sources.md`, the PostgreSQL events page and news archive, and the dev.events/postgres aggregator.
- **Applied & research DB-systems venues close to Postgres** — VLDB, SIGMOD, CIDR, ICDE, DEBS, USENIX ATC/OSDI, plus practitioner conferences (P99 CONF, HYTRADBOI). Use the venue CFP pages and WikiCFP.

For each item give the conference, location + dates, the **CFP deadline**, and the link; tag *(community)* or *(research)*. Confirm the deadline is genuinely still open before listing — a closed CFP is noise.

### 6. Discover emerging sources (self-update)

Each run, spend a little effort looking for **new, high-quality sources** that aren't yet in `references/sources.md`: a new independent engineering blog, a fresh research group page, a newly active newsletter, a conference that just posted proceedings. Good signals are: cited by sources you already trust, written by known contributors, deep technical content with no sales pitch.

When you find a keeper, **append it to `references/sources.md`** under the right section with a one-line note on why it's worth watching. This is how the skill stays current instead of going stale. Conversely, if a listed source has gone dormant or turned into pure marketing, mark it accordingly.

### 7. Filter out marketing, ads, and promotion

This is the core value of the digest. **Exclude** an item (or flag it clearly if it's borderline but still has real content) when it shows the hallmarks of marketing rather than engineering:

- It's primarily announcing a product, pricing, funding round, partnership, award, or "we're now GA" with little technical substance.
- It's a vendor case study whose real purpose is the logo and the CTA, not the method.
- Superlatives without numbers: "blazing-fast", "next-gen", "revolutionary", "game-changing", "enterprise-grade" with nothing measured.
- It ends in a demo booking, free-trial, or "talk to sales" call to action and the body was just a runway to it.
- Reposted press release / sponsored content / listicle SEO bait ("Top 15 databases for 2026").

**Keep** content that teaches or proves something: benchmarks with methodology, internals deep-dives, postmortems, release notes that explain *what changed and why*, research papers, protocol/design discussions, reproducible experiments — even when published on a vendor's blog. A vendor engineering blog post can be excellent; judge the substance, not the domain. When in doubt, ask: "If I strip the company name, is there still something I learned?" If no, cut it.

**Feature-explainer rule (authority gate).** A lot of posts just describe a new or existing feature without adding a new use case, a problem found in the wild, a benchmark, or a non-obvious gotcha. These "here's how feature X works" walkthroughs are only worth including when written by someone with first-hand authority over that feature — its **author, committer, or reviewer** (for Postgres, check the commit / CommitFest / release-note credits; for other engines, the engineer who built or shipped it). If a generic feature explainer is written by someone *without* that direct involvement, skip it — it's usually a rehash. The exception is the moment a feature first ships (a release/beta announcement), which is news regardless of author. When you do include an authority-written feature post, you may note the author's role, e.g. `[by committer]`.

**Commercial-engine techniques.** Actively look for genuinely new techniques and inventions in SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, DB2, and similar — new optimizer/storage/replication capabilities, internals write-ups, and engineering deep-dives. Apply the same anti-marketing filter: a real technique or measured result, not a "what's new in version N" sales sheet.

**Release posts get a changes summary.** When an item is the release of an extension or utility (e.g. "pg_kpart 1.0", "powa-archivist 5.1.2", "pgBackRest 2.x"), don't just say "new release" — read the changelog/release notes and summarise *what actually changed*: the headline new features, notable fixes, breaking changes, and the minimum/target server version. This is the one place to relax the strict one-line limit — a release item may use a short sub-bullet list of the key changes when that's clearer. Skip pure version-bump posts with no meaningful changes, and still drop release posts whose "changes" are entirely marketing.

**Migration experience.** Actively look for real-world migration experience reports — moving to/from Postgres, Oracle→Postgres, MySQL→Postgres, cross-cloud, version upgrades at scale — where the author shares what actually happened (pitfalls, downtime, data discrepancies, tooling, rollback). These are high-value; prioritise them. Generic "why you should migrate to our product" posts are marketing — cut them.

### 8. Fact-check before including

For each surviving item, do a quick sanity pass: does the headline claim match the body? Are benchmark claims accompanied by setup details (hardware, dataset, versions)? Is a "Postgres now does X" claim actually in a release/commit, or just speculation? Cross-check surprising claims against a second source (commit, mailing-list thread, the actual paper). If a claim can't be substantiated, either drop the item or append a short `[unverified]` note so the reader knows.

### 9. Write the digest

Use the exact format below. Keep each line to roughly one sentence — the value is in being scannable. Order items by importance (most significant first), lightly grouped by theme. Aim for ~10–25 items; quality over quantity. If a slow week yields little, a short honest digest beats padding.

## Output format

```

_<N> items · sources scanned: <count> · filtered out as marketing/ads: <count>_
```

Notes on the format:
- **The headline is the link** (`**[Headline](URL)**`) — one big tap target, ideal on a phone; do not add a trailing `[link]`. The one-liner says *why a Postgres hacker should care*, not just what it is.
- **End each item with the author/source in italics**, e.g. `*(Christophe Pettus · thebuild.com)*`. Include the author's name when it isn't already in the one-liner; otherwise just the source/site (or venue, for papers). On a phone this lets the reader triage before tapping.
- Append `[paper]`, `[unverified]`, `[by committer]`, `[vendor blog — substantive]`, or a language tag (`[ru]` `[zh]` `[fr]` `[de]` `[ja]`) only when useful.
- **Non-English items go in their own `## International` section** (don't scatter them across the topical sections). Each gets an English headline + one-liner, a language tag (`[ru]` `[zh]` `[fr]` `[de]` `[ja]`), and the original title in italics in parentheses — e.g. `- **[Inside PolarDB's shared-storage buffer pool](URL)** — how it decouples buffer management from local disk. *(Alibaba Cloud · developer.aliyun.com)* [zh] _(orig: …)_`. Verify technical claims against the original, not just the translation.
- **Release items** (extension/utility releases) may break the one-line rule: give a headline line plus an optional short indented sub-list of the key changes (new features, notable fixes, breaking changes, target server version). Example:
  ```
  - **[pg_kpart 1.0](URL)** — new index-time guard against full-partition scans. *(<author> · <source>)*
      - rejects queries that scan all partitions without the partition key
      - PostgreSQL 18+
  ```
- **Community pulse items** link to the discussion thread and tag the platform plus a rough engagement signal, e.g. `*(Hacker News · 240 pts, 180 comments)*` or `*(r/PostgreSQL · 95 upvotes)*`. Keep to the 3–8 most-discussed threads, deduped against the rest of the digest.
- **Call-for-papers items** are forward-looking, not week-bound: list a conference / PGDay / meetup (and applied DB-systems venues close to Postgres) only while its CFP deadline is still in the future, sorted by nearest deadline, tagged *(community)* or *(research)*.
- **Skip empty sections silently.** Omit any section that has no items — do NOT write "nothing this week", "no items found", or an apology/explanation. A missing section just means nothing qualified; the reader infers that. Never add filler narration about gaps.
- If delivering to Telegram or another plain-text channel later, the same content works; just drop the Markdown headers to bullet groups if the target doesn't render Markdown.

## Example items

**Good (keep):**
`- **[Skip scan lands in Postgres 18](URL)** — btree now skips leading index columns, killing a class of "add a redundant index" workarounds; commit shows up to 20x on low-cardinality prefixes. *(pganalyze.com)*`

`- **[hackers] [Rethink hash join memory accounting](URL)** — Melanie Plageman proposes replacing the current executor-side batch-spill heuristic with a planner-visible cost model; thread has substantive back-and-forth on the right abstraction boundary. *(Melanie Plageman · pgsql-hackers)* [patch posted]`

`- **[bugs] [Logical replication silently drops rows on publisher restart under load](URL)** — confirmed regression in 17.2, bisected to commit abc1234; workaround posted, fix in progress. *(pgsql-hackers)* [open]`

`- **[Why is everyone suddenly moving off RDS?](URL)** — 300-comment HN thread trading cost and lock-in war stories; the substance is the migration tactics in the replies, not the headline. *(Hacker News · 300+ comments)*`

**Bad (filter out):**
`- "Acme DB raises $40M Series B to revolutionize the cloud-native AI-ready database" — funding announcement, no technical content. (excluded)`

`- **[general] How do I speed up my query?** — routine user question with no surprising answer. (excluded)`

## Keeping the skill healthy

The source list is the skill's memory. Treat `references/sources.md` as a living file: add what proves valuable, demote what turns into a billboard. Over a few months this should converge on a personal, high-trust set of sources tuned to what the reader actually finds worth reading.
